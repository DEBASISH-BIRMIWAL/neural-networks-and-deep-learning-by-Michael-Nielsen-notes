# neural-networks-and-deep-learning-by-Michael-Nielsen-notes

## Introduction

**Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen** is a free online book that offers a profound exploration of neural networks—an elegant, biologically-inspired programming paradigm that enables machines to learn from observational data. This book not only covers the foundational concepts of neural networks but also delves into deep learning, a set of powerful techniques that have transformed fields such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

## Why This Book?

I discovered it through a **3Blue1Brown** [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=2). I appreciate the book's unique approach to teaching complex topics. It effectively blends theoretical understanding with practical implementation, ensuring that I gain both conceptual clarity and hands-on experience. By focusing on the core principles of neural networks and deep learning, this book provides insights that remain relevant as technologies evolve.

## Note

I will be updating this repository as I progress further through the book.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by chapters from the book, following this structure:
